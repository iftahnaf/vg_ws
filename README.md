# About Vector Guidance

Guidance laws that were originally developed for missile guidance, but fit very well for guiding drones
that can implement acceleration in all spatial directions. The laws also take into account aircraft
limitations, such as velocity or acceleration saturation. The implementation of the laws is simple,
efficient and doesn’t require high processing power, as most of the solutions are analytical and don’t
require complicated numerical solvers. Using the laws requires knowing or estimating the target’s
range and relative velocity, so the project includes estimation of these values. The laws were
developed by prof. Shaul Gutman.
